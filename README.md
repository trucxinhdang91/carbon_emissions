Project 2: Carbon Emission Analysis
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2eddd273-709a-4928-be22-a219a526c283)
This report aims to analyze carbon emissions to examine the carbon footprint across various industries. We aim to identify sectors with the highest levels of emissions by analyzing them across countries and years, as well as to uncover trends.

Carbon emissions play a crucial role in the environment, accounting for over 75% of global emissions and posing a significant environmental challenge. These emissions contribute to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to climate change, planetary warming, and involvement in various environmental disasters.

Through this analysis, we hope to gain an understanding of the environmental impact of different industries and contribute to making informed decisions in sustainable development.

# Data Source
Our dataset is compiled from publicly available data from nature.com and encompasses the product carbon footprints (PCF) for various companies. PCFs represent the greenhouse gas emissions associated with specific products, quantified in CO2 (carbon dioxide equivalent).

# Data Structure
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db3b829f-ecab-41c1-a5b2-f04bd43d966f)

The dataset consists of 4 tables containing information regarding carbon emissions generated during the production of goods.

The study examines the extraction and processing of all upstream raw materials to produce the products and packaging components; the manufacturing process; distribution logistics; product use and packaging disposal. The work has been conducted using the Ecoinvent database and SimaPro software.  Climate change impacts are measured in kg CO2 equivalents, following the IPCC’s most recent methodology).  Scenario evaluations have been used to examine the importance of several variables in the product comparison. These include a range of possible consumer behaviours regarding the use of the products, such as conditions of refrigeration, washing of glasses, and disposal routes for packaging, among others."                                                         |0.54167  |0                   |45.88                                           |4.92                                            |49.20                                           |

The study examines the extraction and processing of all upstream raw materials to produce the products and packaging components; the manufacturing process; distribution logistics; product use and packaging disposal. The work has been conducted using the Ecoinvent database and SimaPro software.  Climate change impacts are measured in kg CO2 equivalents, following the IPCC’s most recent methodology).
